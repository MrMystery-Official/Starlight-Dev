# Starlight
**Starlight** is a toolkit for modding The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It includes:

-   **AINB Editor:** This visual node editor allows you to effortlessly modify the game's logic data, including AI behaviors and sequences.
-   **Map Editor:** Edit actors directly within a scene using the map editor.
-   **Actor Editor:** Simplify map editing by creating and customizing actors with this built-in tool. It's designed for basic static map actors, not for comprehensive actor creation.

## Installation
-  Specify File Paths: In the menu bar, click "Edit" to access the text fields. Provide the following paths:
    *  RomFS Dump Location: Specify the directory containing your RomFS dump.
    *  Model Dump Location: Path to your model dump. Link to model dump tool: https://gamebanana.com/tools/13236 (A tool for generating a model dump if needed)
        * Please combine the two folders that the tool outputs and pass the path to the combined folder.
-  Save and Restart: Once paths are specified, click "Save" in the menu bar. Finally, restart Starlight to ensure proper configuration.
