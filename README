# Starlight
**Starlight** is a toolkit for modding The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. It includes:

-   **AINB Editor:** This visual node editor allows you to effortlessly modify the game's logic data, including AI behaviors and sequences.
-   **Map Editor:** Edit actors directly within a scene using the map editor. However, please note that the algorithm for generating new hashes is still a mystery. As a result, users will need to manage hash generation themselves.
-   **Actor Editor:** Simplify map editing by creating and customizing actors with this built-in tool. It's designed for basic static map actors, not for comprehensive actor creation.

## Support
